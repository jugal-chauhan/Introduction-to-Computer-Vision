# Introduction to Computer Vision

This repo contains my work on various projects in the domain of computer vision along with the documents I referred to.


## Projects

These projects were performed on Google Colab using Python Notebooks. Please install the required libraries and packages successfully and check for correct directory files before implementation.

- [Project 1 : Gaussian Filter, Median Filter, Separable Filters, Difference of Gaussian, Histogram Equalization, Low/High Pass Filters and Image Sharpening](https://github.com/jugal-chauhan/Introduction-to-Computer-Vision/tree/main/Project%201)

- [Project 2 : Match transformed images using SIFT Features, Scene Stitching with SIFT, Object Recognition with HOG Features](https://github.com/jugal-chauhan/Introduction-to-Computer-Vision/tree/main/Project%202)

- [Project 3 : Pinhole Camera Model, Camera Calibration, Image Classification using SIFT, Nearest Neighbor Classifier, Bag of SIFT Representation, one-vs-all SVMs](https://github.com/jugal-chauhan/Introduction-to-Computer-Vision/tree/main/Project%203)

- [Project 4 : Loading and Preprocessing Data, Training a Network From Scratch, 3 Techniques for increasing accuracy of model, Fine Tuning a Pre-Trained Deep Network, AlexNet, ResNet Network](https://github.com/jugal-chauhan/Introduction-to-Computer-Vision/tree/main/Project%204)

- [Project 5 : Convolution-BatchNorm-ReLU Layer, Generator, Discriminator, Optimizer, pix2pix, GANs, Spectral Normalization](https://github.com/jugal-chauhan/Introduction-to-Computer-Vision/tree/main/Project%205)
